# lerp-ui

A collection of *not so awefully generic* general purpose preact ui components.

### contributing
If you feel my style, you can add your own to the collection and send a pull request, I may polish them up a bit. I will also be slowly adding components as soon they are needed for my specific use cases.


### notes
ways to use the library (precompiled or source?)


### development
`npm run client-dev` to spin up a dev server @ http://localhost:3234
