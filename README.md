#lerp-ui

Want more ui consistency but don't really dig the currently available ui libraries and dont feel like writing stuff from scratch? Then maybe try this barebones collection of *not so awefully generic* general purpose preact ui components...

------
If you feel my style, you can add your own to the collection and send a pull request, I may polish them up a bit. Some of the UI components may use *preact-slide*. I will also be slowly adding components as soon they are needed for my specific use cases.
